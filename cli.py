"""AGENTIC STAR Marketplace entrypoint — one-shot Pod process.

Referenced by this repo's Dockerfile as the image `CMD`. Compiles the agent,
provisions its secrets, then hands off to shared.bootstrap.marketplace_app
for the Marketplace lifecycle (identity, input, events, terminal delivery,
exit). Mirrors agentcore's own `agents/base/chat_agent/cli.py` (the pattern
this file was copied from).

`namespace=` here is the Marketplace secret-provisioning namespace — a different
concept from `config/agent.yaml`'s AgentRegistry `namespace:` key that happens to
share its value. Mirrors
`src/api/server.py`'s existing `secrets_factory(namespace="cmn",
agent_name="cmn-c1-310")` call shape rather than a per-template value: one
Marketplace Pod deploys exactly one template, so there is no cross-template
secret-path collision to guard against.
